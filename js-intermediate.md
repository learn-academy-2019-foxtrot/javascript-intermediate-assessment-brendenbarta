# ASSESSMENT 3: INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What are the HTTP verbs? Which CRUD action corresponds to each verb?

  Your answer:
HTTP is a list of methods that indicate the desired action to be done.
Create = PUT 
Read   = GET
Update = PUT 
Delete = DELETE
Read   = GET
Update = PUT
Delete = DELETE

Researched answer:The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our “uniform interface” constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, OPTIONS and HEAD are used more often than others.

Update = PUT

Read   = GET
Update = PUT
Delete = DELETE

  Your answer: A class is kind of like a vairable and an object is a data type.
